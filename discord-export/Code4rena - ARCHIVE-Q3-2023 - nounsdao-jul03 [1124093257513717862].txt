[07/06/2023 17:59] davidbrai
the function is called using the libraries

{Reactions}
👍 

[07/06/2023 17:59] davidbrai
for example: `using NounsDAOV3Fork for NounsDAOStorageV3.StorageV3;`


[07/06/2023 17:59] davidbrai
you can read about the `using` keyword for libraries


[07/06/2023 18:02] co0nan
does the function `castVote` on V3 internally calls the same function on V2 ?

Hi, I have problem with `forge build` and `forge test --ffi` .
error message is this.
```
[⠒] Compiling...
[⠊] Compiling 202 files with 0.8.19
Error: 
Solc Error: 
```
I can compile with `yarn hardhat compile` or `yarn build`, this happens only with forge.
I'm using node v14.18.2, forge version is 0.2.0. I ran `yarn install` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` at monorepo root, and ran `forge install` and build commands at `packages/nouns-contracts`
