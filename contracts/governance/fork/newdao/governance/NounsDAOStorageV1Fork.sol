/**
 * @title Storage for `NounsDAOLogicV1Fork`.
 * @dev Based on NounsDAOStorageV1, with the following changes:
 * - vetoer is removed.
 * - Vetoed proposal state removed.
 * - implementation is removed, instead it's stored in the ERC-1967 storage slot.
 * - proposals renamed to _proposals to enable the explicit getter, which solves the stack too deep issue with the
 *   default getter.
 * - creationBlock added to Proposal struct, similar to V2, to solve the votingDelay editing bug.
 * @notice For future upgrades, do not change NounsDAOStorageV1Fork. Create a new
 * contract which implements NounsDAOStorageV1Fork.
